- Engineering Organization: 180 FTEs
  - Platform Engineering: 35 engineers (Kubernetes, service mesh, CI/CD)
  - Cloud Infrastructure: 28 engineers (AWS, networking, security)
  - DevOps/SRE: 22 engineers (monitoring, incident response, automation)
  - Quality Assurance: 18 engineers (automated testing, performance testing)
  - Frontend Engineering: 25 engineers (React, TypeScript, design system)
  - Backend Engineering: 32 engineers (Java, Kotlin, Python microservices)
  - Infrastructure: 12 engineers (database, storage, CDN)
  - Engineering Managers: 8 (one per team)
- Key Metrics:
  - Deployment frequency: 49 deployments/week across 8 microservices (3.2x avg per service)
  - System uptime: 99.7% (target: 99.9%)
  - MTTR: 18 minutes (down from 4 hours pre-transformation)
  - Cloud migration: 23 of 47 apps migrated (49%)
  - Engineering satisfaction: 72% (below company average of 78%)
- Attrition: 12% annualized (22 departures in 12 months)
  - Departures by level: 8 Senior Engineers, 7 Mid-Level Engineers, 5 Junior Engineers, 2 Managers
  - Primary exit reasons (from exit interviews conducted by Sarah Mitchell):
    1. Compensation below market (35% of departures cited)
    2. Workload from transformation + BAU demands (30% cited)
    3. Limited career growth for senior ICs (20% cited)
    4. Remote work policy too restrictive (15% cited)
  - Cost of attrition: $4.4M annually (average $200K per departure: $50K recruiting +
    $30K onboarding + $120K productivity loss during ramp)
  - Engineering attrition by team:
    Cloud Infrastructure: 18% (5 of 28 — CRITICAL concern)
    Backend Engineering: 14% (4-5 of 32)
    Platform Engineering: 11% (4 of 35)
    DevOps/SRE: 9% (2 of 22)
    Frontend, QA, Infrastructure: 5-7% (at or below industry average)
  - Retention actions (Sarah Mitchell + Marcus Thompson):
    1. $15K retention bonuses for 45 critical cloud/platform engineers (April 2025)
    2. Technical Fellow career track introduced (IC equivalent to VP, comp $300K+)
    3. Flexible work policy expanded: 3 days remote for engineering (from 2 days)
    4. Skills-based pay adjustment: 12% increase for AWS/Kubernetes certified engineers
- Hiring Pipeline: 40 open positions for FY2026 (offset attrition + transformation growth)
  Current pipeline: 180 candidates in process; 28 offers extended; 15 accepted (53% offer acceptance)
  Target: All 40 positions filled by March 2026
  Recruiting partners: Hired (external recruiter, $480K retainer), LinkedIn Recruiter ($95K/year)
- Compensation: $380K base + $190K bonus target + $600K equity
- Succession Risk: HIGH — No deputy VP; 2 senior engineering managers (Sarah Jennings
  for Platform, Dmitri Volkov for Cloud) are potential successors but need 2-3 years of
  leadership development. If Marcus leaves, cloud migration workstream would be severely impacted.
- Flight Risk: MEDIUM — Marcus has strong market value (Netflix alumni, cloud expertise).
  Unvested equity ($420K) provides retention, but competitor offers could exceed $500K base.
  Dr. Chen conducts quarterly retention check-ins.

Director of Data Science: Jennifer Park
- Reports to: CIO Dr. Robert Chen
- Direct reports: 3 (data engineering manager, ML ops manager, analytics manager)
- Tenure: 1.5 years (appointed January 2024)
- Background: MS Statistics MIT; PhD candidate (ABD) in Machine Learning; former Senior
  Data Scientist at Palantir (2020-2023); 2 published papers on federated learning

  - 3 production ML models deployed (churn predictor, demand forecaster, document classifier)
  - Self-service analytics platform launched (beta, 50 pilot users)
  - Data quality score improved from 58% to 73% (target: 95%)
  - 342 features in feature store (12 feature groups)
  - Vendor savings of $8.7M YTD through strategic negotiations
- Dual Role Risk Assessment (conducted by Linda Nakamura, March 2025):
  "Jennifer is exceptional at both roles but is stretched. The Data Science work is strategic
  and requires deep technical focus. The Vendor Strategy work is operational and requires
  relationship management. Recommendation: Hire a Director of Procurement to take vendor
  operations off Jennifer's plate by Q4 2025, while she retains strategic vendor decisions
  on technology platforms."
  Action: Job req for Director of Procurement posted May 2025; 42 applicants received.
- Compensation: $340K base + $170K bonus target + $500K equity
- Succession Risk: HIGH — Dual role means no single successor. Data Science: ML Ops Manager
  Priya Sharma is strong technically but lacks leadership experience. Vendor Strategy:
  No internal successor; would need external hire.
- Flight Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH — Jennifer's Palantir network creates frequent recruiter interest.
  Dual-role burnout is a concern. Dr. Chen approved a $50K spot bonus (May 2025) for
  successful ML platform launch.

TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM FTE ALLOCATION (of 1,000 total)

| Workstream              | Full-Time Dedicated | Part-Time (50%+) | Apex Consultants | Total Effective |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|

Impact on BAU (Business as Usual):
- 78 FTEs fully dedicated to transformation (7.8% of headcount)
- 44 FTEs split between transformation and BAU
- Remaining 878 FTEs on BAU operations
- Risk: BAU engineering capacity reduced by ~25% in Cloud Infrastructure team
  (10 of 28 engineers fully dedicated to migration; 8 split between migration and BAU)
- Mitigation: 10 contract engineers hired through staffing agency ($1.8M, 12-month terms)
  to backfill BAU infrastructure work
- Marcus Thompson's assessment: "We're managing, but any additional attrition in Cloud Infra
  would force a hard choice between slowing migration or accepting BAU risk."

Key Insight (Sarah Mitchell, March 2025): "Engineering attrition is concentrated in
cloud-specialized roles. The transformation program is actually creating market-ready
talent that competitors are poaching. Our retention strategy must focus on the 45
engineers with AWS/Kubernetes certifications — they are our highest flight risk."
