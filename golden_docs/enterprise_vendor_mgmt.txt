STRATEGIC VENDOR MANAGEMENT REPORT
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL - BUSINESS
Document ID: GOLDEN-VENDOR-001
Date: 2025-05-30
Sector: ENTERPRISE

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's strategic vendor
portfolio, performance metrics, optimization initiatives, and renewal strategy. The
vendor management program is overseen by Jennifer Park, Director of Vendor Strategy,
reporting to Patricia Anderson, SVP Operations. Total annual vendor spend is $78.5M
across 142 active vendors, with the top 3 vendors representing 89% of total spend.

Year-to-date vendor optimization has delivered $8.7M in savings, and we project $12.4M
in FY2026 savings through Reserved Instance optimization, contract renegotiation, and
Tier 3 vendor consolidation. Three major contract renewals occur in 2026: Microsoft EA
($85.5M, June 2026), AWS EDP ($66.9M, December 2026), and Apex Technologies ($18.5M,
December 2026), with a combined renewal value exceeding $170M annually.

TIER 1 STRATEGIC VENDORS — DETAILED PROFILES

1. APEX TECHNOLOGIES
   Service: Systems Integration & Custom Development
   Annual Contract Value: $18.5M (Time & Materials with caps)
   Contract Term: January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2026 (3-year)
   Contract ID: CTR-2024-APEX-001
   Relationship Manager: Marcus Thompson (technical), Patricia Anderson (executive)
   On-Site Team: 45 consultants (12 architects, 18 developers, 8 QA, 4 project managers, 3 data engineers)
   Apex Account Executive: Raj Patel (reports to Patricia Anderson operationally)
   Performance Rating: 4.2/5.0 (trending down from 4.5 at contract inception)

   SLA Performance (Last 12 Months):
   | SLA Metric                    | Target   | Actual   | Breaches | Credits  |
   |-------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
   | Response Time (P1 incidents)  | 30 min   | 42 min   | 3        | $85K     |
   | Staffing Commitment           | 45 FTEs  | 41 FTEs  | 2        | $120K    |
   | Deliverable Quality (defects) | <5%      | 4.8%     | 0        | $0       |
   | Knowledge Transfer            | Monthly  | Monthly  | 0        | $0       |
   Total SLA Credits Received: $205K

   SLA Breach Detail:
   Breach 1 (January 2025): P1 Response Time — SAP integration failure during ERP
   pre-migration testing. Apex team took 2.5 hours to respond (SLA: 30 min). Root cause:
   On-call engineer was not available; backup engineer unfamiliar with SAP CPI adapter.
   Impact: 4-hour outage of development environment; no production impact.
   Remediation: Apex implemented dedicated SAP on-call rotation.

   Breach 2 (March 2025): Staffing — Team dropped to 38 FTEs for 3 weeks due to Apex
   reassigning 7 consultants to another client without notice. Patricia Anderson escalated
   to Apex SVP William Chang. Resolution: 4 replacement consultants onboarded within 2
   weeks; 3 original consultants returned within 4 weeks. $120K credit applied.
   Impact: 2-week delay on ERP Track 2 (custom code remediation). Contributed to 6-week
   overall ERP delay.

   Breach 3 (May 2025): P1 Response Time — Data pipeline failure in Databricks integration.
   Apex architect took 1.5 hours to respond. Impact: 6-hour delay in nightly data refresh;
   downstream analytics dashboards stale for morning users.
   Remediation: Apex deployed PagerDuty integration for their on-call engineers.

   Dependency Assessment (Critical):
   - 4 of 5 transformation workstreams depend on Apex resources
   - Apex has institutional knowledge of 23 legacy applications
   - IP Transfer: All custom code developed by Apex is assigned to client (contract clause 7.3)
   - IP Risk: Clause ambiguity on "derivative works" — if Apex reuses patterns from our
     engagement at other clients, we have limited recourse. Elena Vasquez flagged for amendment.
   - Non-compete: 12 months post-termination; covers all Apex employees who worked on our account
   - Single-source risk: If Apex contract terminated, estimated 6-9 month replacement timeline
     and $4.5M transition cost (knowledge transfer, onboarding new partner, productivity ramp)

   Succession Planning:
   Patricia Anderson initiated secondary integration partner evaluation (April 2025):
   - RFI issued to: Accenture, Deloitte Digital, Cognizant, Infosys
   - Responses received: Accenture ($22M/year estimate), Deloitte Digital ($19.5M/year estimate)
   - Cognizant and Infosys proposals expected by July 15, 2025
   - Evaluation criteria: SAP migration experience, AWS expertise, team continuity commitment,
     IP assignment terms, cultural fit assessment
   - Decision timeline: Shortlist by August 2025; pilot engagement by October 2025
   - Dr. Robert Chen: "We need a credible alternative before we negotiate Apex renewal in Q3.
     Even if we renew with Apex, having a secondary partner reduces concentration risk."

   Renewal Strategy (December 2026):
   - Option A: Renew at reduced scope ($12M, Phase 3 optimization only; transition
     cloud/data workstreams to secondary partner)
   - Option B: Full renewal with amended terms ($16M, address IP clause, add staffing
     guarantees with financial penalties, require dedicated on-call team)
   - Option C: Transition off Apex entirely (risk: 6-9 month disruption; cost: $4.5M transition)
   - Preferred: Option A (Patricia Anderson recommendation, pending Dr. Chen approval)
   - Decision required by: September 2025 (to allow transition planning if Option A or C selected)

2. MICROSOFT CORPORATION
   Service: Enterprise Agreement (Office 365 E5, Azure AD P2, Power Platform, Intune)
   Annual Contract Value: $85.5M (3-year Enterprise Agreement, fixed price)
   Contract Term: July 1, 2023 - June 30, 2026
   Contract ID: CTR-2023-MSFT-EA
   Relationship Manager: Dr. Robert Chen (executive), Jennifer Park (commercial)
   Microsoft Account Team: Sarah Lindberg (Account Executive), Tom Nguyen (Technical Architect)
   Performance Rating: 4.7/5.0

   License Utilization Analysis:
   | Product              | Licenses | Active Users | Utilization | Cost/User/Month |
   |----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
   | Office 365 E5        | 1,200    | 1,080       | 90%         | $57             |
   | Azure AD P2          | 1,200    | 1,200       | 100%        | $9              |
   | Power Platform       | 500      | 312         | 62%         | $40             |
   | Intune               | 1,200    | 1,150       | 96%         | $8              |
   | Azure Credits        | 500/mo   | 420/mo      | 84%         | N/A             |

   Cost Optimization Opportunities:
   - Power Platform: 62% utilization — 188 unused licenses = $90K/year savings opportunity
   - Office 365 E5 to E3 downgrade for 200 non-technical users: $182K/year savings
     (E5: $57/user/month; E3: $36/user/month; delta: $21 × 200 × 12 = $50.4K)
     Note: E3 lacks advanced compliance features; Elena Vasquez reviewing impact
   - Azure credit optimization: Reserved Instance commitment for Azure workloads (not yet
     done; AWS is primary cloud, Azure used for AD sync and M365 integration only)

   Renewal Negotiation Strategy (June 2026):
   - Current annual value: $85.5M
   - Microsoft's expected ask: $90M-$94M (5-10% increase based on CPI and new AI features)
   - Our target: $87M (2% increase, justified by under-utilization and E3 migration)
   - Walk-away price: $92M maximum
   - Negotiation team: Jennifer Park (lead), Dr. Robert Chen (executive sponsor),
     Elena Vasquez (contract terms), Microsoft AE Sarah Lindberg
   - Leverage points:
     1. Under-utilization of Power Platform (62%) — demand credits or removal
     2. E3 downgrade for 200 users — reduces per-seat economics
     3. Competitive pressure: Google Workspace evaluation as backup (no actual plan to switch,
        but creates negotiation leverage)
     4. Early renewal: Offer to sign by March 2026 (3 months early) in exchange for price lock
   - Timeline:
     October 2025: Internal pricing model finalized (Jennifer Park)
     January 2026: Initial meeting with Microsoft AE Sarah Lindberg
     February 2026: Formal proposal exchange
     March 2026: Negotiation rounds (target 2-3 sessions)

TIER 3 VENDOR CONSOLIDATION

Current Tier 3: 118 vendors ($8.5M combined annual spend)
Consolidation Target: Reduce to <85 vendors by December 2026

Consolidation Analysis:
  Redundant vendors identified: 22 vendors with overlapping capabilities
  Categories with multiple vendors:
  - Cloud Storage: 5 vendors (consolidate to AWS S3 + Snowflake only) — saves $340K
  - Email Marketing: 3 vendors (consolidate to HubSpot only) — saves $95K
  - Project Management: 4 vendors (consolidate to Jira only) — saves $120K
  - File Sharing: 3 vendors (consolidate to SharePoint/OneDrive only) — saves $85K
  - Video Conferencing: 2 vendors (consolidate to Teams only) — saves $42K

  Already Eliminated (FY2025 YTD): 14 redundant vendors eliminated
  - Savings realized: $1.5M (annualized)
  - Example: Eliminated separate Dropbox Business ($65K), Box Enterprise ($55K), and
    custom file server hosting ($120K) by migrating to SharePoint Online (included in EA)

  Remaining Consolidation Opportunities: 8 additional vendors targetable in FY2026
  - Projected savings: $680K annually
  - Requires: Migration planning for each vendor exit (data portability assessment,
    contract termination clause review by Elena Vasquez)

VENDOR PERFORMANCE SCORECARD METHODOLOGY

Quarterly review process (implemented Q2 2025 per Patricia Anderson initiative):

Evaluation Dimensions:

VENDOR DATA SOVEREIGNTY COMPLIANCE

| Vendor        | Data Storage Regions | US Data Only? | GDPR Impact | Notes                          |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------|

| Microsoft     | US + EU (M365)      | NO           | YES         | EU data for 28% intl revenue  |
| Snowflake     | US (AWS us-east-1)  | YES          | N/A         | Single-region deployment      |
| Apex Tech     | US (on-site)        | YES          | N/A         | On-site consultants only      |
| CrowdStrike   | US + EU (telemetry) | PARTIAL      | YES         | Falcon cloud telemetry in EU  |
| ServiceNow    | US (Washington DC)  | YES          | N/A         | FedRAMP-ready instance        |

| Splunk        | US + EU             | NO           | YES         | EU log forwarding for intl ops|

Non-US Data Vendors Requiring Action:
1. Microsoft: EU data residency review needed for GDPR compliance (Elena Vasquez leading)
2. CrowdStrike: EU telemetry data — assess if PII is included in threat intelligence feeds
3. Splunk: EU log forwarding — verify no PII in log streams sent to EU cluster
