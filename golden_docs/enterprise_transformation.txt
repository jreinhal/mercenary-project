ENTERPRISE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL - BUSINESS
Document ID: GOLDEN-TRANSFORM-001
Date: 2025-06-15
Sector: ENTERPRISE

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Enterprise Digital Transformation Program is a $150M, 3-year initiative to modernize
the organization's technology infrastructure, business processes, and workforce capabilities.
The program was approved by the Board of Directors on January 15, 2024 and is led by
Executive Sponsor Dr. Robert Chen, Chief Information Officer (CIO).

As of June 2025, the program is ON TRACK with $61.6M of $150M spent, $18.9M in cumulative
cost savings realized, and 49% of cloud migration complete. The program has created 47 new
roles, filed 12 patent applications, and delivered 3 production AI/ML models. Key risks
include a 6-week ERP migration delay, 12% engineering attrition, and single-source dependency
on Apex Technologies for integration services.

  ERP MIGRATION RECOVERY PLAN (APP-001 — SAP ECC 6.0):
  Root Cause Analysis (conducted March 2025 by Patricia Anderson):
    1. Master data migration complexity: 4.2M customer records with 847 custom fields;
       23% of records had inconsistent address formatting requiring manual cleansing
    2. Custom ABAP code: 1,247 custom programs identified; 312 require refactoring for S/4HANA
    3. Integration dependencies: 18 downstream systems depend on SAP IDocs; 6 require
       interface redesign for SAP Cloud Integration (CPI)
    4. Testing environment: Performance testing revealed 3x slower batch processing
       in cloud vs. on-premise for month-end close cycle (12 hours → 36 hours)

  Recovery Plan (approved by Dr. Robert Chen, March 15, 2025):
    Track 1 — Data Cleansing (Patricia Anderson + Apex Technologies team of 12):
      - Automated address standardization: USPS API + Google Maps validation
      - Customer record deduplication: Informatica MDM tool deployment
      - Target: 95% data quality by July 2025
      - Budget: $1.2M (from contingency reserve)
    Track 2 — Custom Code Remediation (Marcus Thompson + Apex dev team of 15):
      - 312 custom ABAP programs categorized: 180 migrate as-is, 87 refactor, 45 retire
      - Code review velocity: 25 programs per week
      - Target: All code remediated by August 2025
      - Budget: $800K (from contingency reserve)
    Track 3 — Integration Redesign (Jennifer Park + AWS solutions architect):
      - 18 downstream interfaces mapped; 6 require CPI adapter development
      - API-first approach: Replace 12 legacy IDocs with REST APIs
      - Target: All interfaces tested by September 2025
      - Budget: $300K (from existing Phase 2 allocation)

  Revised ERP Go-Live: October 15, 2025 (originally September 1, 2025)
  Parallel Run Period: October 15 - November 30, 2025 (6 weeks, extended from 4)
  Full Cutover: December 1, 2025
  Risk if Further Delayed: Phase 3 start slips to February 2026 (1 month buffer consumed)

  Total Phase 3 Annual Savings: $22M (conservative $15M in first year, $22M run-rate by Year 2)

- Phase 3 Key Dependencies:
  1. ERP migration MUST complete by December 2025 (parallel run success)
  2. Jennifer Park's self-service analytics launch MUST hit September 2025 (500 users)
  3. Apex Technologies IP clause amendment MUST execute before December 2026 renewal
  4. 40 new engineering hires MUST onboard by March 2026 (offset attrition)
  5. ISO 27001 gap assessment MUST complete by March 2026 (David Kowalski leading)

CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS (Dr. Robert Chen, May 2025):
The critical path runs through Cloud Migration → ERP (APP-001) → Process Automation
(Month-End Close, Revenue Recognition). If ERP slips beyond December 2025, three
Phase 3 process automations are blocked, potentially costing $1.8M in delayed savings.

Dr. Chen's decision (May 15, 2025): "We will hold Phase 3 start date of January 2026
regardless. ERP parallel run can overlap with Phase 3 launch for other workstreams.
Marcus and Patricia will co-own a dedicated ERP transition team of 8 engineers + 6
Apex consultants through February 2026 if needed."
