Revenue Growth Drivers:
1. Software Licensing (+14.9%): 32 new enterprise agreements signed in FY2025 (Jennifer Park's
   vendor strategy team supported commercial negotiations). Self-service analytics platform
   beta generated 8 upsell conversions worth $3.6M incremental ARR.
2. Managed Services (+15.2%): Cloud-native managed service offerings launched Q2 2025
   enabled by transformation infrastructure. 12 existing customers migrated from legacy
   managed services to cloud-native tier at higher price points.
3. Training (+14.9%): Certification program demand increased as customers sought transformation
   expertise. Sarah Mitchell's workforce transformation methodology licensed to 3 customers.
4. Professional Services (+9.8%): Slower growth reflects shift from project-based to
   subscription-based revenue model. 15% of FY2024 PS revenue ($61.5M) converted to
   recurring Managed Services in FY2025.

| Depreciation & Amort    | $28M     | $32M     | 2.8%     | +14.3%     | Cloud capex amortization increase   |
| Total Operating Expense | $805M    | $880M    | 77.2%    | +9.3%      | OpEx growth below revenue growth    |

Transformation Cost Impact Analysis:
  Total transformation spend in FY2025: $62.8M (Phase 2)
  Where it shows up in financials:
  - R&D: $28M (cloud infrastructure, ML platform, security tooling)
  - Cost of Revenue: $18M (Apex Technologies consulting, migration labor)
  - G&A: $12M (program management, compliance, legal reviews)
  - Capex (not in OpEx): $4.8M (hardware, software licenses capitalized)

  Net Transformation P&L Impact (FY2025):
  Transformation cost (in OpEx): $58M
  Less: Cost savings realized: ($18.9M)
  Less: ML business value: ($7.0M)
  Net incremental cost: $32.1M (2.8% of revenue)
  Implication: Without transformation spending, EBITDA margin would be 22.8% instead of 20.0%.
  However, transformation-enabled revenue (cloud-native managed services, analytics upsells)
  contributed approximately $45M in FY2025 revenue — meaning the transformation is
  revenue-accretive even before full savings ramp.

HEADCOUNT AND COMPENSATION

| Category               | FY2024 | FY2025 | Change | Cost Impact |
|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Total FTEs             | 960    | 1,000  | +40    | +$6.8M      |
| Average compensation   | $142K  | $148K  | +4.2%  | +$5.7M      |
| Total compensation     | $136M  | $148M  | +8.8%  | +$12M       |
| Stock-based compensation| $18M  | $22M   | +22.2% | +$4M        |

| People cost % revenue  | 18.6%  | 18.2%  | -0.4pp | Leverage    |

Engineering Compensation Analysis:
- Average base salary (all engineering): $168K (up 6% YoY)
- Average total compensation (base + bonus + equity): $235K
- Cloud/Platform engineers: $195K average base (15% above company engineering average)
- ML/AI engineers: $205K average base (22% above average; highest-paid engineering specialty)
- Median market rate for cloud engineers (NYC): $210K
- Compensation gap vs. market: -7% for cloud engineers, -10% for ML engineers
- Sarah Mitchell's recommendation: "We need a 10-12% salary adjustment for cloud and ML
  engineers in Q1 2026 to close the market gap. Cost: $2.4M annually for 45 affected engineers.
  This is cheaper than replacing them — attrition replacement cost is $200K per departure."

OUTLOOK (FY2026)

Revenue Guidance: $1.28B - $1.32B (+12-16% YoY)
  Assumption 1: Organic growth +10% (customer base expansion + 2% average price increase)

  Share Repurchase: $20M authorized by Board (opportunistic; no fixed schedule)
  Dividend: None (Board deferred dividend consideration to FY2027)

Planned Headcount Additions: +120 FTEs (→ 1,120 total)
  Engineering: +40 (cloud, data, AI/ML specialists)
    - To offset ~22 projected departures (12% attrition × 180 FTEs)
    - Net engineering growth: +18 FTEs
  Sales / Customer Success: +50
    - 30 sales (support revenue guidance of $1.28B-$1.32B)
    - 20 customer success (improve retention from 94.8% to 96%)
  G&A: +30
    - Finance: +8 (permanent CFO + team expansion; eliminate interim CFO risk)
    - Legal: +4 (IP counsel hire, GDPR DPO, 2 contract managers for renewal volume)
    - HR: +3 (engineering recruiters)
    - Marketing: +10 (product marketing for new cloud-native offerings)
    - Other: +5

Key Catalysts:
  1. Phase 3 optimization expected to unlock $15M+ annual savings (conservative)
