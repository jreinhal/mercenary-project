Classification: HIPAA PROTECTED - PHI REDACTED
Analysis Date: November 2025

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This report presents the patient outcomes analysis from the SENT-2025-001
clinical trial, focusing on disease-free survival, quality of life metrics,
and subgroup analyses by demographic factors.

Principal Investigator: Dr. Amanda Chen, MD, PhD
Biostatistician: Dr. Maria Rodriguez, PhD

SURVIVAL OUTCOMES
================================================================================

6-MONTH DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL: 89.3%

Survival Analysis by Stage at Detection:
- Stage I Detection: 96.2% disease-free survival at 6 months
- Stage II Detection: 88.4% disease-free survival at 6 months
- Stage III Detection: 71.2% disease-free survival at 6 months

Comparison to Historical Controls:
- AI-Assisted Detection Group: 89.3% DFS
- Standard Screening Historical Rate: 78.1% DFS
- Improvement: 11.2 percentage points (p<0.001)

================================================================================
QUALITY OF LIFE METRICS
================================================================================

OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENT: 23%

Measured using validated instruments:
- EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer)
- FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General)
- SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey)

Quality of Life Domains:
1. Physical Functioning: +18% improvement
2. Emotional Well-being: +27% improvement
3. Social Functioning: +22% improvement
4. Cognitive Functioning: +15% improvement
5. Fatigue Reduction: -31% (improvement)

Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.7/5.0 (94% satisfaction rate)

================================================================================
DIAGNOSIS TIME IMPROVEMENT BY AGE GROUP
================================================================================

Overall Time to Diagnosis Improvement: 47% reduction

Improvement by Age Group:
- Ages 18-40: 52% reduction in time to diagnosis
- Ages 41-55: 49% reduction in time to diagnosis
- Ages 56-70: 45% reduction in time to diagnosis
- Ages 71+: 38% reduction in time to diagnosis

Analysis Notes:
Younger patients showed greater improvement, potentially due to:
- Higher digital literacy and engagement with AI-assisted platform
- More complete imaging data availability
- Fewer comorbidities affecting diagnostic clarity

================================================================================
SUBGROUP ANALYSES
================================================================================

BY GENDER:
- Female patients: 90.1% disease-free survival
- Male patients: 88.4% disease-free survival
- No statistically significant difference (p=0.34)

BY CANCER TYPE:
- Breast cancer: 92.3% DFS (n=145)
- Lung cancer: 85.7% DFS (n=98)
- Colorectal cancer: 88.9% DFS (n=76)
- Prostate cancer: 91.2% DFS (n=68)
- Other: 86.4% DFS (n=100)

BY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS:
- Access disparity noted: Rural patients 6% lower early detection rate
- Recommendation: Expand telemedicine access for underserved populations

================================================================================
COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Healthcare Cost Reduction:
- Average cost savings per patient: $12,400
- Total projected annual savings: $6.2 Million (at current enrollment)
- Cost per QALY gained: $18,200 (highly cost-effective threshold: <$50,000)

Resource Utilization:
- Reduced unnecessary biopsies: 34%
- Reduced repeat imaging: 28%
- Shorter hospital stays: 2.1 days average reduction
